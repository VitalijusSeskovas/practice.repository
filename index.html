        <p><h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
        Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us. 
        It’s not all in your head—you can practice mindfulness by sitting down for a formal meditation practice, or by being more intentional and aware of the things you do each day. <br><br>

        Mindfulness meditation is one technique, but everyday activities and tasks provide plenty of opportunities for mindfulness practice. Brushing your teeth: Feel your feet on the floor, the brush in your hand, and your arm moving up and down. 
        Doing dishes: Savor the feeling of the warm water on your hands, the look of the bubbles, and the sounds of the pans clunking on the bottom of the sink. 
        Doing laundry: Pay attention to the smell of the clean clothes and the feel of the fabric. Add a focus element and count your breaths as you fold laundry.  
        Driving: Turn off the radio—or put on something soothing, like classical music. Imagine your spine growing tall, find the half-way point between relaxing your hands and gripping the wheel too tightly. Whenever you notice your mind wandering, bring your attention back to where you and your car are in space. 
        Exercising: Instead of watching television while on the treadmill, try focusing on your breathing and where your feet are as you move. 
        Getting kids ready for bed: Get down to the same level as your kids, look in their eyes, listen more than you talk, and savour any snuggles. When you relax, they will too. </p>

        <h2>Impact of Mindfulness Meditation</h2>
            <p><strong>Reducing stress</strong>: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a standardized therapeutic approach to mindfulness meditation, has been shown to reduce symptoms of stress in healthy individuals. The practice has also been found to be beneficial for a number of mental and physical disorders including anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. </p>
            <p><strong>Lower heart rate</strong>: Heart disease is one of the top causes of death in the United States and research suggests that mindfulness may be beneficial for your heart. In one study, participants either enrolled in an online mindfulness meditation program or were added to a waitlist for traditional treatment for heart disease.2 Those who participated in mindfulness meditation had significantly lower heart rates and performed better on a test of cardiovascular capacity. </p>
            <p><strong>Improved immunity</strong>: Research also suggests that mindfulness practices may improve your body's resistance to illness. One study compared the impact of both mindfulness and exercise on immune function.3 They found that people who had taken part in an eight-week mindfulness course had greater gains in immune function than those in the exercise group. </p>
            <p><strong>Better sleep</strong>: Studies have also shown that practicing mindfulness meditation might improve sleep and even be useful for treating certain sleep disturbances. One 2019 study found that mindfulness meditation significantly improved sleep quality.<br>Making mindfulness meditation a regular practice can lead to stronger effects, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you need to do it every day.</p>
